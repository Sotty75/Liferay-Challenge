# Test Challenge Summary

1. Test Plan and Test Cases can be found in the folder `Test Plan`.

2. Test Automation for some of the test cases are in the `src/test/java` folder

    - The chromedriver needs to be located under `C:/chromedriver/chromedriver.exe`
    - I used a page object model
    - I used JUnit as test runner (there is a Maven referent to TestNG which i then didn't use)
    - All code was written using the Eclipse IDE
    - Selenium Webdriver libraries were been added to the project by using Maven
    - There are two tests which fail due to the bugs in the form

3. The bugs are reported in MD format under the `Bug Reports` folder
	

I am unfortunately not familiar with the Java development environment, all my experience was done on the Microsoft .Net eco-system, I tried to re-apply my knowledge on this test, and had to go often to look for resources online about how to setup and write Selenium code in JAVA.
I personally have a much more elaborate framework and most of the waits are handled automatically in my daily use, so i generally do not have to write explicit / implicit waits, it may be i didn't follow the correct best practices.

It was in any case an interesting exercise.

I wrote this before to upload this to a github repository, so i hope i won't mess with that as well as I use it only with personal projects (we use TFSC at my workplace also, with plans to move to GIT our repository.

Thanks,
Paolo
