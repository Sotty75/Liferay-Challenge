# Test Plan

## Application Under Test
The application under test consists in a web form requesting the user to input basic personal details in the scope of a QA role evaluation.
The form is available in two different languages, english and portuguese, and is made of three fields which are all mandatory:

- Two text input fields
- One date field

and a Submit button.

On submission the system shows a page reporting the operation was successfully completed.

## Test Strategy

The following test cases can be used to validate the functionality:

**Submit on Valid Data**

The user enters valid data using the English language and submits the form.

**Submit on Missing Data**

The user submits the form without entering any data or partial data.

**Mandatory Fields Test**

Verify the mandatory checks are correctly applied/cleared when the user operates the form.
The mandatory checks are cleared when the fields are correctly filled after a validation error.

**Localization Test**

We verify that when switching between the two languages all the string are properly translated across the UI.
The user enters valid data using the Portuguese form
